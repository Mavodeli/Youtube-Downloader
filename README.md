# Youtube-Downloader
a simple tool.

If you have git installed you can clone the repository using `git clone github.com/Mavodeli/Youtube-Downloader`. 

Then you can use the file named "update using git pull" to update the tool. 

You can also download it through the github release or one of these links:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/jr09qdej3vpslg0/youtube-downloader.zip?dl=1

http://mavodeli.de/youtube-downloader/

in this case you need to use "update using website" to update, which fails if my server is unavailable. 



This is basically just an ease of use script for https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp (used to be youtube-dl previously)


How to use:
1. (first use) extract zip to folder of your choice
2. open youtube-downloader(.bat)
3. paste target url
4. Enter a folder name, this folder will be created and contain the downloaded videos after completion
5. choose whether you want to extract the audio of the video(s). enter y or Y and press Enter to do so.  
(default formats for audio/video are mp3/mp4)
7. Upon completion press any button to exit.
