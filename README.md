# Youtube-Downloader
a simple tool.

If you have git installed you can clone the repository using 

`git clone https://github.com/Mavodeli/Youtube-Downloader`

Then you can use the file named "update using git pull" to update the tool. 

You can also download it through the github release or one of these links:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/jr09qdej3vpslg0/youtube-downloader.zip?dl=1

http://mavodeli.de/youtube-downloader/ 

You need to unpack the zip file to use the downloader. Also note that in this case you need to use "update using website" to update, which fails if my server is unavailable. 



This is basically just an ease of use script for https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp (used to be youtube-dl previously)


How to use:
1. open youtube-downloader(.bat)
2. paste target url
3. Enter a folder name, this folder will be created and contain the downloaded videos after completion
4. choose whether you want to extract the audio of the video(s). enter y or Y and press Enter to do so
5. Upon completion press any button to exit
